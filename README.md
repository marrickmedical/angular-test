# Bookshelf
## Objective
This test will demonstrate your ability to:
1) Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
    - Scaffold a new project and run a development server.
    - Adding components and services.
2) Make Asynchronous Http Requests
    - [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
3) Build Intuitive UI/UX Design
    - [Material Design](https://material.angular.io/) (feel free to use a CSS Framework like Bootstrap along side Material Design)
4) Use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Goal
You will build a 'Bookshelf'. This is a simple one page application. The goal of the application
is to manage a UI Bookshelf that can be:
- Added to
- Deleted from
- Sorted (by at least book name)

There will also need to be a search functionality. The complexity of the search is up to you
but it needs to at least search by book name. Listen to input into the search box and make API requests
to Google (be sure to `debounce` the input so you are not sending requests on every key press).

***Your code should be clean, easy to follow, and well documented.***

*To clarify: You will be adding books to the UI, not to a users Google Cloud books account.*

### Good luck! We look forward to seeing your result!
